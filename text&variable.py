# Here we will see how text and variable work together

txt = "variable works."
print("This is how text and " + txt)# using + sign the output is presented

# Other way is using arithmetic operators to add the variable

pretext = "This is how text and "
jointext = "variable works."
completetext = pretext + jointext
print(completetext)# This also gives the same result

#Remember you cannot add variable and number. that is error
